"""Audit the Highlighted PDF: is every real change marked, and is every mark a real change?

IEEE Access asks for the revised manuscript with every individual change highlighted. Two
ways that goes wrong, and neither is visible by reading the PDF:

  under-marking  a genuine revision is not highlighted, so a reviewer cannot see what moved
  over-marking   something is highlighted that did not substantively change, which points a
                 reviewer at a non-issue

Two classes are deliberately held constant before the diff and must therefore NOT be marked:
the reference list, reordered into citation order, and six rounding-only corrections from
the double-rounding bug in code/render/figures.py. Both are recorded in CHANGES.md. This
check confirms they are absent from the markup, and that everything else that differs is
present in it.

Usage:  python3 submission/check_highlighting.py [base_ref]
Exit:   0 highlighting faithful, 1 a discrepancy
